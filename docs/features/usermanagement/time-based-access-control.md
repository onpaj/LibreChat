# Time-Based Access Control Feature Specification

## Overview

Time-based access control feature that restricts user login access to specific time windows based on group membership. This feature provides administrators with granular control over when different user groups can access the LibreChat platform.

## User Story

**As a system administrator**, I want to configure time-based access restrictions for different user groups so that I can control when users can send prompts into the platform based on organizational policies, security requirements, or operational schedules.

## Epic Breakdown

### Epic 1: User and Group Management Foundation
- Implement user group management system
- Create group assignment functionality  
- Establish group-user relationships in database

### Epic 2: Time Window Configuration
- Design time window definition system
- Create time window management interface
- Implement time zone support

### Epic 3: Access Control Logic
- Implement prompt time validation
- Create access control middleware
- Handle edge cases and overlapping windows

### Epic 4: Administrative Interface
- Build group management UI
- Create time window configuration UI
- Implement user-group assignment interface

### Epic 5: User Experience & Communication
- Design access denied screens
- Implement informative error messages
- Create user notifications for upcoming restrictions

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: User Group Management
- **FR1.1**: Administrators can create, edit, and delete user groups
- **FR1.2**: Groups have unique names and descriptions
- **FR1.3**: Users can be assigned to multiple groups
- **FR1.4**: Group membership can be bulk imported/exported
- **FR1.5**: Groups support hierarchical structures (optional)

### FR2: Time Window Configuration
- **FR2.1**: Administrators can define time windows for each group
- **FR2.2**: Time windows support:
  - Daily recurring schedules (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM)
  - Weekly patterns (e.g., Monday-Friday only)
  - Specific date ranges
  - Exception dates (holidays, maintenance windows)
- **FR2.3**: Multiple time windows per group are supported
- **FR2.4**: Time zones are configurable per group or globally
- **FR2.5**: Time windows can be temporarily disabled without deletion

### FR3: Access Control Logic
- **FR3.1**: Login attempts are validated against user's group time windows
- **FR3.2**: If user belongs to multiple groups, access is granted if ANY group allows access
- **FR3.3**: System administrators bypass all time restrictions
- **FR3.4**: Active sessions are handled gracefully when time window expires:
  - Show warning and allow grace period of 5 minutes, after which user is logged out
- **FR3.5**: Failed login attempts due to time restrictions are logged

### FR4: Administrative Interface
- **FR4.1**: Group management dashboard showing:
  - All groups and their member counts
  - Active/inactive time windows
  - Recent access attempts and blocks
- **FR4.2**: Time window visual editor with:
  - Calendar view for date ranges
  - Weekly schedule grid
  - Time zone selector
  - Preview of upcoming allowed/blocked periods
- **FR4.3**: User management interface showing:
  - User's group memberships
  - Effective time windows for each user
  - Last login attempts and status
- **FR4.4**: Bulk operations for user-group assignments

### FR5: User Experience
- **FR5.1**: Clear error messages when access is denied, including:
  - Reason for denial
  - Next available access time
  - Contact information for assistance
- **FR5.2**: Optional email notifications to users about:
  - Upcoming access restrictions
  - Changes to their group's time windows
- **FR5.3**: User dashboard showing their effective access windows

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: Database Schema
```
Groups Table:
- id (PK)
- name (unique)
- description
- created_at
- updated_at
- is_active

UserGroups Table:
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK)
- group_id (FK)
- assigned_at
- assigned_by (FK to users)

TimeWindows Table:
- id (PK)
- group_id (FK)
- name
- window_type (daily, weekly, date_range, exception)
- start_time
- end_time
- days_of_week (JSON array)
- start_date
- end_date
- timezone
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at
```

### TR2: API Endpoints
```
Group Management:
GET /api/admin/groups
POST /api/admin/groups
PUT /api/admin/groups/:id
DELETE /api/admin/groups/:id

User-Group Management:
GET /api/admin/groups/:id/users
POST /api/admin/groups/:id/users
DELETE /api/admin/groups/:id/users/:userId

Time Window Management:
GET /api/admin/groups/:id/time-windows
POST /api/admin/groups/:id/time-windows
PUT /api/admin/time-windows/:id
DELETE /api/admin/time-windows/:id

Access Validation:
POST /api/auth/validate-access-time
GET /api/user/effective-access-windows
```

### TR3: Authentication Middleware
- Extend existing JWT authentication to include time-based validation
- Create middleware function `validateTimeBasedAccess(req, res, next)`
- Integration points:
  - Login endpoint
  - Session validation
  - Protected route access

### TR4: Performance Considerations
- Cache user group memberships and time windows
- Optimize time window calculations for large user bases
- Index database queries for user-group lookups
- Consider Redis caching for frequently accessed data

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Time-based access validation should add < 50ms to login process
- Support for 10,000+ users with multiple group memberships
- Time window calculations should handle 100+ groups efficiently

### NFR2: Security
- All time-based access configurations require admin role
- Audit logging for all access control changes
- Prevent privilege escalation through group manipulation
- Secure handling of time zone configurations

### NFR3: Usability
- Intuitive time window configuration interface
- Clear visual indicators for active/inactive time windows
- Responsive design for mobile access to admin interfaces
- Import/export functionality for group configurations

### NFR4: Reliability
- Graceful fallback behavior if time service is unavailable
- Data validation for all time window configurations
- Atomic operations for group membership changes
- Backup and recovery procedures for access control data

## Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

### SC1: Overlapping Group Memberships
- User belongs to groups with conflicting time windows
- **Resolution**: Most permissive access wins (logical OR)

### SC2: Time Zone Changes
- Daylight saving time transitions
- Server time zone changes
- **Resolution**: Store all times in UTC, convert for display

### SC3: Active Session Management
- User's time window expires during active session
- **Resolution**: Configurable behavior (immediate logout vs. grace period)

### SC4: System Clock Issues
- Server time synchronization problems
- **Resolution**: Fallback to allow access with warning logged

### SC5: Empty Groups or Missing Time Windows
- User belongs to group with no time windows defined
- **Resolution**: Default policy (allow vs. deny) - configurable

## Migration and Rollback Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Schema
1. Create new tables for groups, user-groups, and time windows
2. Add feature flag for time-based access control
3. Populate default "All Users" group with existing users

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
1. Implement group management APIs
2. Add time window validation logic
3. Update authentication middleware
4. Comprehensive testing

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
1. Build admin interfaces for group management
2. Create time window configuration UI
3. Update login flow for better error handling
4. User-facing access window displays

### Phase 4: Rollout
1. Enable for admin testing only
2. Gradual rollout to user groups
3. Monitor performance and adjust
4. Full deployment

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag allows instant disabling
- Database changes are additive (no data loss)
- Authentication falls back to existing logic
- Admin interface shows rollback options
